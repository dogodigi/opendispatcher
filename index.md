### What is Opendispatcher?

Opendispatcher is a modern client server application that uses maps to provide First Responders with essential and critical information about locations, facilities and sites during incident action. Opendispatcher evolved from the Dutch national standard for **Digitale bereikbaarheidskaarten**, a standard that helps identify locations, important information for operating during an incident and hazards. Opendispatcher is a pure browserbased solution and harnesses a responsive design enabling the use on tablets and smartphones.

Opendispatcher implements EU-GHS and NEN1414 symbology to display information on the map.
